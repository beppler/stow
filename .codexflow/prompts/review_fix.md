Task: Implement fixes based on the plan AND the review report.

Hard rules:
- You must follow agents.md.
- You must respect the plan’s scope (only files listed in “Files to change”).
- If a fix requires changing additional files or expanding scope, STOP and update the plan first.

How to apply:
- Treat every unchecked checkbox ([ ]) under Findings as an item to address.
- Prefer minimal, targeted changes.
- If you disagree with a finding, explain why in a short note and do not change code for it.

Finish by:
- Updating the review report by checking off addressed items ([x]) and optionally adding short “Resolution” notes.
- Reporting:
  - Summary of fixes
  - Tests run + results
